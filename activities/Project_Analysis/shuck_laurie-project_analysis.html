	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
    <p>The goals for the <a href="http://www.lettherebeshade.com">Creative Designs &amp; Beyond</a> website is to generate new residential and commercial customers and showcase the company’s prior work. The owners, Mike and Sandi Nagy, would like the site to convey the image of a trusted family business that has their client's best interests in mind. The owner's would also like the site to be visually appealing and user friendly.</p>
	<p>The goals for the user's of the Creative Designs &amp; Beyond website include finding information about residential/commercial exterior remodeling, viewing images of the company’s prior work, scheduling a free in-home estimate, and/or locating the company’s contact information.</p>
	<p>Currently, the Creative Designs &amp; Beyond website does not have a form to schedule a free in-home estimate. In addition, the site is in need of a redesign to help with visual appeal, and to make the site more user friendly. The header navigation with the text “Click for more info on,” needs to be streamlined. The site has plenty of great images and content; they just need to be rearranged to create a more visually appealing and user friendly site.</p>

	<h2> Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>There are many websites that offer exterior remodeling; however there are not many that have enough data to rank their sites, according to the analytics website <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa.com</a>. The Creative Designs &amp; Beyond website falls into the category of not having enough data to rank its site. 
The competitors that I have located each have a homepage that features a large image and have a form to schedule an estimate. They sites are visually appealing and user friendly; however each has some design issues that should be addressed.
</p>
	<p>The following information will show the analytics for three competitive websites.</p>

	<h3>Steve Jackson</h3>
    <p><span>Location:</span> Palo Alto, CA</p>
    <p><span>Gender:</span> Male</p>
    <p><span>Age:</span> 42</p>
    <p><span>Occupation:</span> Director of Technical Support at a large IT company</p>
    <p>Steve works as a Director of Technical Support at a large IT company. He is constantly in meetings and does not have time for small talk. Steve has been married for 23 years and has three children. Steve and his wife have recently become grandparents, and would like to have a beautiful setting for the many family photos they will be taking in the future.</p>

	<p>Steve is extremely tech savvy. He thinks, “If you are a company without an internet presence that you must not want to remain in business.” When he goes to a website, he wants it to make sense, or he gets frustrated. If the website is not up to his standards, he will move on until he finds one that does meet his standards. Steve believes that if a website is not designed well that the company is not run well. Steve bases his purchasing decisions on the look and feel of a website, as well as, the quality of the work the company has done in the past. Steve owns a smartphone, a tablet and a laptop.</p>

	<p>When Steve visits the <a href="http://www.lettherebeshade.com">lettherebeshade.com</a> website, he is looking for images of sunrooms and adjustable louvered patios. He would like to fill out a form to schedule a free in-home estimate because he does not have time to call and he is in a hurry.</p>

    </div><!--end of the user persona 3 img div-->
	<h3>Susan Davis</h3>
    <p><span>Location:</span> Pacifica, CA</p>
    <p><span>Gender:</span> Female</p>
    <p><span>Age:</span> 48</p>
    <p><span>Occupation:</span> Librarian</p>
    <p>Susan is a married and is a part-time librarian. Her son is moving back to the Bay Area with his wife and their three beautiful daughters. Susan is excited to spend quality time with her granddaughters and would like to have an adjustable louvered patio installed. Susan’s husband loves to grill “rain or shine,” so he would like a covered area while Susan would like a comfortable place to relax while she watches her granddaughters play in the backyard.</p>

	<p>Susan does not own a computer, but has recently purchased an iPhone. Computers are intimidating to Susan; however, she is perfectly comfortable using the desktop computer at work. Susan does a majority of her web searches while she is at work, but is slowly learning how to access the Internet on her iPhone.</p>

	<p>When Susan visits the <a href="http://www.lettherebeshade.com">lettherebeshade.com</a> website, she is looking for images of adjustable louvered patios that she can print off to show to her husband. She jots down the company’s phone number on the printed images, so she can call to receive a free in-home estimate if her husband likes the images.</p>
